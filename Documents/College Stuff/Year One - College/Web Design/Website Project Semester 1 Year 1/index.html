					<p class="lyricsOne">
						The light is fading<br>
						Everything dissolves in blue<br>
						As we become one with what surrounds<br>
						Crawl back into the womb<br>
						But it's getting colder<br>
						There's no comfort in this place<br>
						Even now that we're still so far away<br>
						From this point on there's only one direction: down<br>
						</br>
						From this point on all we do<br>
						Is let ourselves sink down<br>
						Until the bottom, until we hit the ground<br>
						Sinking towards the unknown inside of ourselves<br>
						Towards me and towards you<br>
						Towards the essence, towards truth<br>
						</br>
						It's getting dark now<br>
						But I'm still trying to follow you<br>
						There is not always a reason<br>
						But everything can be traced back to a cause<br>
						So much is sure<br>
						I'm ready to dig it all up<br>
						But so far there's not much<br>
						I recognize in your dissection of me<br>
						</br>
						When we're coming close to this familiar place<br>
						That has not lost its appeal<br>
						Fears we need to face:<br>
						To break out of these cycles<br>
						We must rebuild this all from scratch<br>
						Start all over again<br>
					</p></br>

				<div id="region3">"Bathyapelagic I: Impasses"</br></br>
					<p class= "lyricsTwo">
						Try to make sense out of what we've been through<br>
						And I still justify the things I used to do<br>
						I don't believe in nothing - but I believe in you<br>
						Take my word and move on<br>
						</br>
						I've chosen to embrace all the things that I cannot change<br>
						But I'm not sure if this helps to relieve you from bitterness<br>
						</br>
						I wish I could recall every word, everything you said<br>
						You're digging in the past: a deep hole that will wolf you down<br>
						I've chosen to embrace all the things that I cannot change<br>
						But I'm not sure if this helps to relieve you from bitterness<br>
						</br>
						How much control do we have over what we wish for?<br>
						How much control do we have over what we wish for?<br>

				<div id="region4">"Bathyapelagic Ii: The Wish in the Dreams"</br></br>
					<p class="lyricsThree">
						And when the day arrives, I will be petrified<br>
						Pressure is increasing with every meter that we sink<br>
						But I won't let it get inside of me<br>
						We're still too far away to be afraid<br>
						</br>
						I wanted to shape and change them<br>
						But it's they who've changed me<br>
						I wanted to get on top of them<br>
						But they wouldn't let me<br>
						</br>
						They're as elusive as air:<br>
						As soon as we name them they are gone<br>
						Their meaning disappears<br>
						Melts like an icicle in the sun<br>
						</br>
						I wanted to shape and change them<br>
						But it's they who've changed me<br>
						I wanted to get inside of them<br>
						But they wouldn't let me in<br>
						</br>
						How much control do we have over what we wish for?<br>
						How much control do we have over what we wish for?<br>
						How many decisions we take are rational?<br>
						How much is intentional?<br>

					<p class="lyricsFour">
						We sink through boundless vasts of blue<br>
						When we come home at last: you'll see for yourselves<br>
						How far down into the black these rays can reach<br>
						</br>
						Coming true there is only what accords with your nature<br>
						With your being - of which you know nothing<br>
						But it's there, inside of you<br>
						Controlling you 'til the day you die<br>
						</br>
						How far down into the black can sunlight reach?<br>
						Low light, our eyes open wide:<br>
						There's something underneath<br>
						</br>
						So you braced yourself once again<br>
						Dread has made you come to your senses<br>
						Well, you set everything in motion<br>
						A disequilibrated stable state:<br>
						This is where it all began<br>
						Now face the reaction<br>
						</br>
						So you braced yourself once again<br>
						Pain has made you come to your senses<br>
						Now your life is easy<br>
						Stripped of all responsibility:<br>
						That's my reward for you<br>

				<div id="region6">"Abyssopelagic I: Boundless Vasts"</br></br>
					<p class="lyricsFive">
						We sink through boundless vasts of blue<br>
						When we come home, at last: you'll see how silent it is<br>
						This must be the most forlorn place in the world<br>
						You'll see for yourselves<br>
						What about us? Do you feel anything?<br>

					<p class="lyricsSix">
						Last night I had a dream<br>
						I saw her in the distance<br>
						She walked towards the sea<br>
						</br>
						She was standing close to the shore<br>
						She watched the waves erode<br>
						And she said: "You'll understand later"<br>
						</br>
						Then she cast a stone into the foam<br>
						While something occurred to her:<br>
						Something broke in her<br>
						</br>
						Then she disappeared<br>
						But things are no longer what they seem<br>
						I can't say if it was real<br>

						I can feel<br>
						These circles will always touch in more than one point<br>
						Repelled and pulled towards each other: repelled again<br>
						Unconditional projection alternates with short<br>
						Fervid intervals of perfection and boundless bonding<br>
						</br>
						But be sure: trust needs to be reevaluated<br>
						While our aging promises turn to plights<br>
						And their weight and meaning changes<br>
						Differing sizes of intersections:<br>
						Territories abandoned, lost and reclaimed<br>
						Everything's in constant motion<br>
						</br>
						So let them live with the contradictions<br>
						Between what they call passion<br>
						And the constraints of our modern living<br>
						Which leave no space for the irrational<br>
						</br>
						And most importantly<br>
						Let them have confidence and peace<br>
						Let them be powerless<br>
						But most surprisingly<br>
						They're not afraid of how they'll feel<br>
						When they come closer<br>
						</br>
						All these restrictions are self-inflicted:<br>
						Let them be helpless<br>
						Let them embrace symbols of commitment<br>
						To compensate for the lack of it<br>
						</br>
						I can feel<br>
						These circles will always touch in more than one point<br>
						Repelled and pulled towards each other: repelled again<br>
						Regulations and restrictions determine how we live<br>
						And what we've got to give<br>
						</br>
						But be sure: trust needs to be reevaluated<br>
						While our ageing promises turn to plights<br>
						</br>
						Change is what scares us shitless<br>
						</br>
						Most importantly<br>
						Let them have confidence and peace<br>
						Let them be powerless<br>
						But most surprisingly<br>
						They're not afraid of how they'll feel<br>
						When they come closer<br>
						</br>
						Symbols of commitment to disguise the lack of it<br>
						Let them believe<br>
						Let them believe in themselves<br>
						And let them live with their contradictions<br>
						What they call passion is just the turmoil<br>
						Caused by repression of their ambitions<br>
						Let them believe<br>

						And there was a great earthquake<br>
						And the sun turned black as sackcloth made of hair<br>
						And the moon became like blood<br>
						And the stars of the sky fell to the earth<br>
						As a fig tree casts its unripe figs<br>
						When shaken by a mighty wind<br>
						And the sky was split apart<br>
						Like a scroll when it is rolled up<br>
						</br>
						And every mountain and island<br>
						Were moved out of their places<br>
						And the kings of the earth and the great men<br>
						And the strong and every free man<br>
						Hid themselves in the caves<br>
						And they said to the mountains:<br>
						</br>
						"Fall on us, fall down on us<br>
						And hide us from...<br>
						Fall on us, fall down on us<br>
						And hide us from the presence of Him<br>
						Who sits on the throne<br>
						And from the wrath of the Lamb<br>
						For the great day of His wrath has come<br>
						Hide us from the presence of Him<br>
						For the great day of His wrath has come<br>
						And who shall be able to stand?"<br>

					<p class="lyricsNine">
						We are now on the threshold<br>
						Hold your breath and close your eyes<br>
						</br>
						This is what you have been hoping<br>
						And waiting for all your life<br>
						</br>
						Enter the room<br>
						</br>
						But don't have any illusions:<br>
						I will not forgive you<br>
						</br>
						And the worst thing is<br>
						That you won't ever forgive yourself for this<br>
						</br>
						Enter the room<br>
						</br>
						There's no one here<br>
						No one can harm them here<br>
						Oh, God..<br>
