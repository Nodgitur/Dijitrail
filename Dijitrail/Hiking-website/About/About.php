        <br>
        <p style = "font-size: 20px;">Entirely made within COVID-19, the three month long project tested our knowledge with new software and languages.
        Comprising of the Google Maps API, MySQL database with Heroku and Xampp, and a variety of computing languages.
        We had the aim of creating a website where hikers, and wannabee hikers could share and find trails as they go.
        We set out on a task of letting the community decide on what stood out to them the most, including an account system linked allowing you to review each trail.
        This pandemic has hurt all of us including the website. We hope that you enjoy what we have done, and who knows, maybe there might be some updates in the future!</p>
